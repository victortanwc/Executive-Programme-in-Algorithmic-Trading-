    "\n",
    "Suppose there are \"n\" parallel coin toss games going on. Since, each game is similar in payoff structure (2:1) with 50% probability of win and has infinite future games ahead of it, we can assume that the proportion invested \"f\" remains constant over the games and is invested equally across the games without the loss of generality. Hence, each game gets f/n.\n",

As seen from previous scenarios, because of infinite games in parallel, it is optimal to invest entirely in the games. The amount of investment in the games that have won in last games is assumed to be “f” and the amount in lost games is “1-f”. These amounts will be equally divided among games within each of these sets.  Since, there will be infinite set of games in each set (Won/Lost), returns per set will be uniform across periods. Hence, the allocation “f” and “1-f” is assumed to remain the same post period 2. Using 500 Monte Carlo simulation trials and by varying f, average maximum return per period is computed.
